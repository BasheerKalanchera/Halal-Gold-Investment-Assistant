Are Gold ETFs Shariah Compliant?
Gold ETFs are Shariah Compliant because they are backed by physical gold which is one of the important conditions for investment asper Shariah (other conditions are investment in money market instruments should not be more than 1.5% of the AUM and interest income should not be more than 3% of total income). When an investor invests in units of gold ETF, gold of that same value is bought in the fund and stored with the custodian and its value or even quantity of gold equivalent to the value of the Gold ETF units at prevailing market price (in case of large investors) are delivered to investors on demand, against redemption of the units. TASIS releases monthly lists of Shariah Compliant Gold ETFs based on the tolerance criteria advised by its Shariah Board.
---
Is Investment in Sovereign Gold Bonds Shariah Compliant?
Sovereign Gold Bonds are not backed by physical gold and on redemption the cash is paid to the investor and not the physical gold. As these are debt instruments, the investors also get a fixed interest per annum on their investment in these bonds. Hence, investment in Sovereign Gold Bonds is Shariah non-compliant.
Allah Knows Best...

AAOIFI’s Shari’ah Standard on Gold:
The AAOIFI Shari’ah Standard on Gold was developed in collaboration with the World Gold Council offers definitive guidance on the use of gold in Islamic finance.
The Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) is recognised as the world leader in Islamic finance standards, and its rulings are widely accepted across many Islamic markets.
AAOIFI’s Shari’ah Standard on Gold, launched in 2016, has acted as a catalyst for the development of new Shari’ah- compliant gold products including gold investment accounts, physical gold ETFs, spot contracts and regular gold savings plans. Some of the world’s top Shari’ah scholars were involved in its development, including Sheikh Yusuf DeLorenzo and YBhg Tan Sri Dr Mohd. Daud Bakar.
Five Most Important Principles of the Standard
The Standard sets out the conditions that must be met when investing or transacting in gold, ensuring that the world’s 1.6bn Muslims can benefit from Shari’ah-compliant gold products.
The Standard sets out several principles, the five most important being:
1.    Gold must be traded on a spot (hand-to-hand) basis;
2.    Gold can be owned on a physical or constructive basis;
3.    In the case of constructive possession, the gold has to be fully allocated;
4.    Allocation can occur through either a T+0 settlement, or the receipt of a certificate/ confirmation specifying bar ownership;
5.    Joint ownership is permissible, where each partner owns an undivided beneficial interest in a Trust.
The Standard is available for download in English, Arabic, and Turkish:

Why jewellery a bad as an investment? 
Jewelers in India adopt several unfair practices in selling jewellery all of which result in you losing out:
When you're buying there can be some short measure in weight of gold. Most common way is presence of artificial diamonds and stones.
Jeweler will take making charges which are huge 10-30% of the value. So even if your gold appreciates by 20%, you earn nothing.
While selling also there will be some short charge and you will be at loss.
In the name of Hallmark certified jewellery, you will be charged more than normal.
Ordinarily too you might never get jewellery at market rate.
You can be deceived as to whether its 22 carat or 20 carat.

Halal Gold Investment Ideas
-Jewellery
Probably the most common and unintentional investment that people have been making since ages. Actually given the attachment of most women to gold, I think this is probably never an investment since it can never be sold. It can at max be converted from one ornament to another.
- Pure Gold (coins/ biscuits)
Best way for investment purpose. No problems related to rates/ purity/ weight or any other charges. No issues in selling either since buying/ selling is at near market rate. And good thing is it can be purchased quite easily..
---
Following are Non-Halal Gold Investments
Disadvantages:
Tax deduction: All below schemes will deduct tax on profit earned at rate of 20%.
All below will cut something like 2% to 5% owing to maintenance fees or administrative charge or something else. Some of it will be recurring.
They are illegal according to Islamic rules.
Why they are not legal: It is because of one simple aspect that by Islamic law, we have to take the possession of goods once we have paid for it - gold in this case. While the whole point of these things is mostly not keeping physical gold. In most of below schemes there is no such arrangement. And even if the arrangement exists it is either namesake or after a long duration. Hence forbidden.
- Gold ETF (Exchange Traded Funds)
They are a way to invest in gold storing them in electronic form with the ease of the stock market. Means they are financial products which invest entirely in physical gold. Investors having demat account can buy and sell them similar to any other stocks on the exchange. You cannot get physical gold for the stock even though the company is buying it. All major MF players will have one.
- Gold Mutual Fund
There are no pure Gold Mutual Funds in India
- Gold Saving Fund (Fund of Funds) 
They are mutual funds that invest almost entirely in Gold ETF. They are worst off then gold ETF due to additional charges for managing it. Only thing is you can invest without demat. All major MF players will have one fund which will be linked to their own ETF.
- International Commodities Sectoral Funds 
They are mutual funds that invest overseas in gold and in shares of gold mining/ trading companies. Mostly they invest in gold related companies rather than in gold.
- eGold
e-Gold was launched from the exchange NSEL Its very much like Gold ETF , where you can invest in Gold in online format. For investing in E-Gold you still need a demat account with one of the companies authorised by NSEL The difference from ETF is that you can also take physical delivery of gold with some terms and conditions. It is no longer available now since it was closed down due to some regulator issues. 
- Gold Futures (Commodities market)
This is an entirely betting market where you bet on the future price of a commodity right now. People may argue that futures are for hedging but that is theory...its 100% gambling.
- Gold Investment/ Deposit Schemes
These are mostly started by jewelers in which you invest some fixed amount every month and after few years take physical delivery of the gold.
Some other financial companies also offer similar schemes.
- Gold Government Bonds
These are similar to gold funds but better in the sense they are from a more secure institution plus these funds also give interest. So what you earn is the price of gold and the interest fixed by government. However, these are yet to be launched and details are awaited.
- Gold Monetization Scheme
This is also a scheme soon to be launched by the government. It is exactly similar to Gold Deposit scheme with the difference that gold will be deposited with the banks and you will earn interest on it.

Most Gold savings schemes offered by local jewellers are:
Not compliant with Shariah principles
Not an efficient method to accumulate gold. 
---
Difference between Islamicly 24K Real Gold vs Gold Savings schemes offered by Local Jewellers are:
1. SPOT Price
Gold purchase and sales must happen at the prevailing SPOT price and the sale should be executed immediately. Fixing the price before the sale and possession of GOLD is not permissible in Shariah law.
In traditional Jewellers Gold Savings Scheme: Gold grammage corresponding to the installment date and amount is recorded. No sale is conducted. There is no tax invoice issued for such a sale in your name.This essentially means that the Gold price is fixed before the sale transaction making it non compliant. 
Islamicly 24K Real Gold is quoted at the spot prices prevailing in the market. You get a tax collected invoice in your name that the sale of the gold to you is instantly completed. Your tax invoice is evidence of the sale being completed.
2. Ownership and Possession
Gold must be physically delivered to the buyer. Transactions involving gold must ensure that the buyer takes immediate possession (i.e., no speculative buying, and no deferred payment arrangements) to avoid any form of riba (interest).
In Traditional Jewellers Gold Savings Scheme: Since the sale of gold has not taken place, the question of possession does not arise. A Gold transaction where physical possession is not taken by the buyer or his agent is considered non permissible under Shariah law
Islamicly 24K REAL Gold is instantly delivered and possession of the same is taken by the buyers and stored in secured vaults by Brinks. ​​The gold purchased is securely stored in high-security vaults managed by Brink’s, a globally renowned custodian for precious metals.
3. Purity and Authenticity
The gold must be pure and genuine, meaning it meets the proper quality standards and does not contain other substances or be mixed with other materials that are not permissible under Islamic law.
In Traditional Jewellers Gold Savings Scheme: There is always a possibility that the purity of gold does not meet the stated standards, and no benchmarking is available. Islamicly 24K REAL Gold is certified as 24 carat with 99.99% purity.
4. Fractional Buying
With the rising prices of Gold, buyers usually have to accumulate funds to buy GOLD. With Islamicly 24K REAL Gold, you can buy Gold starting at just INR 100! 
When buying or investing in Shariah-compliant gold, investors often look for products such as gold bars, coins, or certificates that can be verified to meet these principles. Some financial institutions and gold dealers also offer products like gold-backed Islamic certificates or gold savings accounts that adhere to Shariah laws.
---

What Are The Types of Shariah Based Gold Investments?
 1. Physical Gold (Bars and Coins)
Gold Bars: Investors can purchase physical gold bars of various weights and purity. These bars are stored in secure vaults and are directly owned by the buyer.
Gold Coins: Similar to bars, gold coins are bought for long term investment. These coins must also meet specific purity standards and be verified as legitimate. The physical possession of the coin or bar makes it a tangible investment, which aligns with Shariah principles.
2. Gold-Backed Securities/Certificates
These are certificates issued by banks or financial institutions that represent ownership of physical gold. The certificates themselves are Shariah-compliant as they are backed by real gold.
The gold must be stored in a secure vault, and the certificates can be traded on the market. Investors can buy and sell these certificates without actually holding the physical gold but still maintaining Shariah compliance by ensuring the gold is physically stored and owned.
3. Gold ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)
Shariah-Compliant Gold ETFs are funds that allow investors to invest in gold without the hassles of possessing the physical gold. These funds track the price of gold, and the investments are backed by physical gold holdings in a vault.
The ETF must be structured in a way that avoids any riba (interest) or speculative practices (gharar), meaning it should invest directly in physical gold, and the trading of the ETF should not involve any interest-bearing loans or derivatives.
Such Gold ETFs must be certified as Shariah compliant for access to Shariah compliant investors
4. Gold-Linked Islamic Investment Funds
These are mutual funds or investment funds that invest in gold or gold-related assets, such as gold mining companies. These funds are managed in a way that complies with Shariah law and are required to be certified as Shariah compliant.
The investment fund may be structured to avoid interest (riba) and unethical practices, and it typically invests in tangible assets such as gold and ensures that no speculative activities are involved.
5. Gold Mining Stocks
Some investors may choose to invest in gold mining companies that are structured in a way that complies with Shariah law. These stocks must be carefully vetted to ensure that the company’s gold trading activities are Shariah compliant and do not involve haram (forbidden) activities.
Investments in mining companies are typically subject to Shariah screening by a Shariah board, which ensures that they do not engage in activities that conflict with Islamic principles.
6. Gold Backed Islamic Bonds (Sukuk)
Sukuk are Islamic bonds that can be linked to gold or gold backed assets. The returns on these bonds are derived from gold or gold-related investments, ensuring the Shariah compliance of the transaction.
---
The gold-backed Sukuk provides an opportunity for investors to participate in gold-related investments while adhering to the principles of Islamic finance.
Is Gold a Halal Investment?
Gold holds deep roots in Islam from Qur’anic verses to the Gold Dinar. But is it still halal in today’s markets? Discover how Muslim investors can trade gold ethically through physical gold, ETFs, sukuk, and more, all Shariah-compliant and AAOIFI approved.
Gold has a special place in Islamic history. Halal Gold investment is in the hearts and portfolios of Muslim investors.
From Qur’anic verses that mention Gold and silver as means of trade, to classical Islamic jurists who debated its role as money, Gold has long been viewed as a store of value, a hedge against uncertainty and a legitimate asset in Islamic finance and Halal Investing.

Gold isn’t just another shiny metal. It holds deep significance in Islam and Islamic finance.
It is one of the six Ribawi items mentioned in Hadith literature, meaning it is subject to strict rules when exchanged. These rules, according to the majority of Islamic scholars, exist to prevent injustice, exploitation and ambiguity in trade.
That’s why Riba, Gharar and Maysir are prohibited in Islamic finance. And it's why many Muslims see Gold as a stable and ethical asset that aligns well with Shariah values.
Historically, Islamic civilisations used the Gold Dinar and silver Dirham as currency. Many scholars today still regard physical Gold as a reliable store of value and a means of wealth preservation.
Gold is also mentioned in the Qur’an as a measure of wealth and as a test of character. For example, in Surah Al-Zukhruf (43:33 to 35), Gold is described as a symbol of worldly luxury, reminding believers not to be distracted by material wealth.
In more modern times, Gold Investment in the UAE has a rich history. Before it became a financial metropolis and the UAE became a centre for Islamic finance, the Gold Souk was and still is a key hub for Gold Investment in Dubai.
---
So, is Gold Halal?
The short answer is yes, but only when it is bought and sold in accordance with Shariah.
That said, not all Gold investments are equal.
If you're purchasing physical Gold (like bars, coins or jewellery) with immediate payment and delivery, that’s widely considered Shariah-compliant.
But when it comes to paper Gold, Gold ETFs or derivative-based products, things get more complicated. Some of these involve Riba-bearing instruments, speculative contracts or no real ownership, all of which would be considered non-compliant from an Islamic perspective.
Some scholars and platforms, including Tabadulat, follow AAOIFI standards.
AAOIFI Shariah Standard 57 (co-written with the World Gold Council) requires Gold must be fully owned (either physical or constructive basis), immediately settled, equal in weight and purity as well as completed hand-to-hand to be considered truly Shariah-compliant.
In the case of constructive possession, the gold has to be fully allocated. Allocation can be done through either a T+0 settlement, or the receipt of a certificate or confirmation of specific bar ownership.
---
Gold Investment for the Long Term
Gold’s appeal isn’t just spiritual, it’s also financial.
Between January 2020 and May 2025, Gold prices increased from around $1,520 per ounce on 2 January 2020 to $3,500 per ounce on 22 April 2025. This marks a strong performance given the economic volatility of recent years.
---
What’s behind this spike? 
Several factors led to the growth
Economic uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions and conventional banking instability
Rising inflation and weakening currencies
Increased demand from central banks and institutional investors
Although Gold doesn’t pay dividends like stocks or rent like real estate, it acts as a hedge against inflation and currency depreciation, protecting portfolios when other assets decline.
That’s why many Muslim investors consider Gold a valuable part of a diversified, Halal portfolio.

How to Trade Gold Halal
If you’re looking to invest in Gold, here are four Shariah-compliant ways to do it:
1. Physical Gold: This involves tangible Gold investment bars, coins, or jewellery.
   * Pros: Tangible asset, no counterparty risk, historically reliable
   * Cons: Storage costs, security risks, no income
   * Halal Compliance: The transaction must involve full payment and prompt delivery. Avoid schemes with delayed delivery or instalment plans that add extra fees. Under AAOIFI, Gold needs to attain a specific level of purity to be considered Halal.
2. Halal ETFs (Gold-Backed): These are ETFs that track the price of Gold and are backed by physical holdings. Some are structured to meet Shariah standards.
   * Pros: Convenient, liquid, easy to trade
   * Cons: Management fees, indirect ownership
   * Halal Compliance: Always check that the ETF is physically backed, avoids Riba, and is approved by a recognised Shariah board. Usually, you can trade Gold-Backed ETFs through an investment app.
3. Islamic Gold Investment Accounts: These are accounts offered by some Islamic banks where you accumulate grams of Gold instead of traditional currency.
   * Pros: Affordable entry point, real ownership
   * Cons: Limited availability, potential fees
   * Halal Compliance: Make sure the provider offers full transparency on pricing and Shariah compliance.
4. Gold-Backed Sukuk: Some sukuk are structured with Gold as the underlying asset, offering periodic income while maintaining Shariah compliance.
   * Pros: Income-generating, asset-backed
   * Cons: Limited exposure to the Gold spot price
   * Purpose: These are best for investors who want income as well as Halal exposure to Gold.

What Role Should Gold Play in a Halal Portfolio?
Every investor is different. But broadly, Gold serves three key functions:
Preserving capital during inflation and uncertainty
Diversifying risk across asset classes
Aligning with Islamic values of wealth protection
However, Gold isn’t a growth asset. It doesn’t generate income, and its value can fluctuate based on global demand and currency strength.
That’s why Gold is best seen as a complementary asset, not the core of your Halal portfolio.
---
Reminders with Halal Gold Investments
Before looking at Halal Gold investments, Muslim traders should be aware of four things:
Leverage and speculation: Many Gold products (like Contracts for Difference and futures) involve margin trading, which violate Shariah
No real ownership: Some platforms let you “invest” in Gold without actually owning any physical metal
Riba-bearing structures: Avoid Gold investments that involve earning or paying Riba
Under AAOIFI, Zakat of Income from Gold is obligatory when Shariah rules are met.

---
Is investing in gold halal or haram?
Investing in gold is halal if done according to Shariah principles. Physical gold is permissible when bought with immediate payment and delivery. However, some gold products like futures or margin trades, may involve Riba or Gharar, which are not compliant. For halal investing, focus on physical gold, Shariah-compliant ETFs, or gold-backed sukuk.
---
Are gold ETFs Shariah-compliant?
Some gold ETFs are Shariah-compliant, but not all. To be halal, the ETF must be backed by physical gold, avoid Riba-based structures, and follow Islamic rules on ownership and settlement. Always check if the ETF has been reviewed or certified by a recognised Shariah board.
---
What is the AAOIFI standard for gold investment?
Yes! AAOIFI Shariah Standard 57 requires that gold must be physically owned, fully paid for and delivered without delay. It also stipulates that the Gold must be equal in weight and purity as well as allocated. This ensures gold investments follow Islamic principles. Shariah-compliant options include physical gold, an approved ETF, and gold-backed sukuk.
---
How can Muslim traders invest in gold ethically?
Muslim traders can invest in gold by choosing Shariah-compliant options like physical gold with immediate payment and delivery, approved gold ETFs backed by real assets, Islamic gold investment accounts, or gold-backed sukuk. All investments should avoid Riba, Gharar, and delayed settlement.
---
What is the difference between halal gold investment and paper gold?
Halal gold investment involves real ownership of physical gold, with immediate payment and delivery. Paper gold usually refers to contracts or products that track gold prices but don’t give actual ownership, and may involve Riba or Gharar. Not all paper gold is Shariah-compliant.
